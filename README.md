### 🚀 Projects

#### 📌 [Spotify Analytics Project](https://github.com/KajalS99/Spotify-Analytics-Project)
> Full pipeline: Data Cleaning → EDA → Classification Models  
Analyzed track metadata to identify factors that influence Spotify track popularity using logistic regression, XGBoost, and ensemble models.

#### 📌 Heart Disease Prediction (Coming Soon)
> Classification problem using health records to predict cardiovascular disease risk, using Decision Trees and Logistic Regression.

#### 📌 Reservation Management System (PHP + MySQL)
> Built a backend prototype for a facility reservation platform — involving queries, validation logic, and system design based on SAD principles.
