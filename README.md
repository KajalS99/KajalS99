## About
Early-career data analytics professional specializing in applied machine learning and computer vision. I design reproducible workflows, convert raw data into reliable features, build and evaluate models using defensible methodology, and communicate results for decision-making.

- Interests: computer vision, classification, feature engineering, model evaluation  
- Tools: Python, SQL, TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Tableau  
- Looking for: entry-level data/ML roles where I can keep learning by shipping real, production-minded analyses and models
